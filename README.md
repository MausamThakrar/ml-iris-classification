# Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning Example)

This project demonstrates a basic supervised machine learning workflow
using the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn.

The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species based on four features:
sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

## Techniques Used

- Train/test split
- Feature scaling
- Model training with multiple algorithms
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Random Forest
- Accuracy evaluation
- Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score)
